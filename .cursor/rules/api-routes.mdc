# API Routes

The CRM application exposes several RESTful API endpoints:

## Customer Routes

[src/routes/customers.js](mdc:src/routes/customers.js) provides endpoints for:
- Customer registration and profile management
- Appraisal requests and results
- Customer activity tracking

## Email Routes

[src/routes/email.js](mdc:src/routes/email.js) provides endpoints for:
- Sending email reports
- Email template management
- Email tracking and analytics

## Authentication and Middleware

- Middleware functions in [src/middleware](mdc:src/middleware) handle:
  - CORS configuration
  - Request validation
  - Authentication and authorization
  - Rate limiting

## API Structure

All routes follow RESTful principles and include proper error handling. The routes are registered in [index.js](mdc:index.js) as part of the Express application setup.
